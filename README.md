I am an MSc Cyber Security student in the United Kingdom with a strong background in computer engineering and over ten years of hands-on experience in IT support and systems operations. My professional journey has involved supporting enterprise environments, troubleshooting complex technical issues, and maintaining reliable and secure IT infrastructures.

My current academic and practical focus is on network security, threat analysis, and secure systems design. Through this GitHub profile, I document hands-on labs, security experiments, and projects involving Python, networking, and security operations. The repositories here reflect my commitment to applying theory to real-world security challenges and continuously developing industry-relevant skills.
